    Legacy uppercase manifests are not special-cased: they have no ``[run]``
    section, so DLKit's own validation in ``load_job()`` already fails fast
    with ``ConfigValidationError: No run.type found...``.

    ``load_job()``'s return type also covers ``ConvergenceJobConfig``/
    ``MultiRunJobConfig`` (sweep-level configs, not one job) — rejected here
    since this function's contract is "one job", matching its callers
    (per-assignment training/search/fit/inference). ``FitJobConfig`` (one-shot,
    non-gradient fit jobs, e.g. POD-2G basis fitting) is a single job like any
    other and is returned like any other — consumed via the same
    assignment/training pipeline as ``TrainingJobConfig``/``SearchJobConfig``
    (see ``composition/assignments/_job_types.py::TrainableJobConfig``).

    Raises:
        ConfigValidationError: *path* resolves to a sweep-level config
            (``run.type`` of ``"converge"`` or ``"multirun"``).
